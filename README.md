# Yat
Project Yat (Ять) aims to build a custom pipeline to automate the transcription of historical handwritten documents from JINR’s archives. We are developing system tailored for complex Cyrillic script, with a human-in-the-loop workflow to drastically reduce manual effort and enable efficient digitization of scientific heritage.
